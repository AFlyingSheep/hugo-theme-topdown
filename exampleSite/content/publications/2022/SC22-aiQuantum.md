Abstract: "The quantum many-body problem is one of the most important problems in condensed matter physics. The understanding of novel phenomenons like superfluid, supersolid, superconductivity depends on accurately solving the quantum many-body problems [1]. Nowadays, the mechanisms of superconductivity is still under debate [2]–​[4], therefore efficiently solving the quantum many-body models will accelerate the discovery of room-temperature superconductors."
