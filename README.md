# TOP-DOWN

A **developing** Hugo theme meticulously crafted for personal/team/lab/start-up **presentations**, featuring an intuitive **top-down organizational** structure.

> [!CAUTION]  
> The project development is still in the conceptual stage.

## test site

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kirrito-k423/hugo-theme-topdown.git topdown
cd topdown/exampleSite/
hugo server --themesDir ../.. -t topdown --bind=222.195.72.221 --baseURL=http://222.195.72.221 -p 1314 -D -d ../../../public_2
```

## Why It's Necessary for Me

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you have great ideas, please let me know

1. While there are numerous outstanding personal blog themes using various static site generators (SSG), a free one designed specifically for presentations using SSG is notably absent.
   1. Many utilize [HTML5 templates](https://themefisher.com/free-responsive-website-templates-html5-css3), but I find them challenging to maintain.
2. Influenced by the notion that every presentation should follow a top-down structure, I believe in presenting the key or abstract of our work first. This approach allows the reader to decide whether to delve deeper by using a "LEARN MORE" button.
3. I consider the template crucial for CEOs/employees to keep their mission in mind and for visitors to quickly grasp information about the organization or product. Everyone should be able to efficiently obtain the information they seek.

## My Ideal Theme

1. The homepage features a prominent slogan and a full-screen background picture, with the rest of the Hugo pages divided into interleaving color sections.

2. These sections provide abstracts or recent events in each sub-topic, accompanied by a "LEARN MORE" button.

3. Each sub-topic page is also organized with high-level information first, followed by detailed content.
