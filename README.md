# TOP-DOWN

A **developing** Hugo theme meticulously crafted for lab/company/personal **presentations**, featuring an intuitive **top-down organizational** structure.

## Why It's Necessary for Me

(If you have great ideas, please let me know)

1. While there are numerous outstanding personal blog themes using various static site generators (SSG), a free one designed specifically for presentations using SSG is notably absent.
   1. Many utilize [HTML5 templates](https://themefisher.com/free-responsive-website-templates-html5-css3), but I find them challenging to maintain.
2. Influenced by the notion that every presentation should follow a top-down structure, I believe in presenting the key or abstract of our work first. This approach allows the reader to decide whether to delve deeper by using a "LEARN MORE" button.
3. I consider the template crucial for CEOs/employees to keep their mission in mind and for visitors to quickly grasp information about the organization or product. Everyone should be able to efficiently obtain the information they seek.

## My Ideal Theme 

(If you find a similar one, please tell me. ~~So I can be free~~)

1. The homepage features a prominent slogan and a full-screen background picture, with the rest of the Hugo pages divided into interleaving color sections.

2. These sections provide abstracts or recent events in each sub-topic, accompanied by a "LEARN MORE" button.

3. Each sub-topic page is also organized with high-level information first, followed by detailed content.

## Developing Steps for Me

(I hope to finish this during my free time before June 2024, the time I graduate from school)

1. [ ] Learn how SSG works.
2. [ ] Modify some existing templates.
3. [ ] Implement more detailed functions.

If someone wants to join me or complete these tasks for me, I would be grateful for the assistance.
