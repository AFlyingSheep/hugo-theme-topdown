# TOP-DOWN

**TOP-DOWN** is a Hugo theme meticulously crafted for personal, team, lab, or start-up presentations. It features an intuitive top-down organizational structure, ideal for effective and impactful displays.

## Features

- **Intuitive Top-Down Logic:** Sections are arranged logically to emphasize importance, priority, and the hierarchical relationship among them.
- **Automatic Publication Linking:** Effortlessly auto-link publications on individual profile pages.
- **Database-Like Organization:** Emulates a database structure for content management. For example, `event` is treated as a database, where `event/xxx.md` represents a database entry. The YAML metadata in `event/xxx.md` articulates the specifics of each entry.
